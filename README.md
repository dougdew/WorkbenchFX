WorkbenchFX
===========

Salesforce API workbench implemented with JavaFX

This project is a Maven project. You should be able to build and run this project using any Maven-aware IDE.

The code in this project uses JavaFX and lambdas. Therefore, this project depends upon JDK8.

The drop down list for selecting a server is intentionally blank. For now, it is up to you to add entries to that list. You can add entries to that list by adding code to LoginController.java.

The drop down list for api version shows many versions, but for now, it is only correct to select the version for which you've generated stubs.
